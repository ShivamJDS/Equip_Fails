# Eqip_Fails
##Eqipment failure prediction, solving kaggle problem using classical machine learning

In this we will learn to solve kaggle, problem end to end.
That is from Exploratory data analysis to prodictionization

Go to this link for blog related to this problem

"Data" folder contains all the data, i.e. all training data, test data, saved pickle files and saved models
"EDA" folder contains detailed explanation of data.
"Feature_Engineering" this folder contains ipynb file of feature engineering
"All_Type_Of_Models" this folder contain ipynb in which I have attempted 4 diffrent type of machine learning algorithm
"Stacking_Classifier" this folder contain ipynb file of our best model, this model is stacking classifier, this is trained only on 70% of training data.
"Productionizable_Code" this is final ipynb file, this can be used directly to production.
